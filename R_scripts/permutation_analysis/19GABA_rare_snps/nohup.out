Reading map (extended format) from [ 07_19GABA_rare_snps.bim ] 
15 markers to be included from [ 07_19GABA_rare_snps.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ 07_19GABA_rare_snps.fam ] 
875 individuals read from [ 07_19GABA_rare_snps.fam ] 
875 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
126 cases, 749 controls and 0 missing
508 males, 367 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ 07_19GABA_rare_snps.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 15 SNPs
782 founders and 93 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.999086
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 15 SNPs
After filtering, 126 cases, 749 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 508 males, 367 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Full-model association tests, minimum genotype count: --cell 5
